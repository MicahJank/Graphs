1. Describe in graphs terminology
- What are our nodes?
-- The rooms are the nodes
- When do we have an edge to another node? What connects two nodes/rooms together
-- the exits/rooms to the n,s,e,w of the current room are the edges - they are what connect rooms

2. Build your graph or define getNeighbors()
 player.current_room.get_exits() is already defined for me which i can use to get the neighbors

3. Choose your algorithm
